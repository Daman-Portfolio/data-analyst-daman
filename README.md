## 📊 Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
As part of Exploratory Data Analysis the first 
### 🔹 Project Title:
**Exploratory Analysis of Employee Remuneration in Vancouver**

### 🔹 Objective:
To explore employee remuneration and expenses data from the City of Vancouver to identify trends, patterns, and insights related to department spending and employee compensation.

### 🔹 Dataset:
Sourced from the [City of Vancouver Open Data Portal](https://opendata.vancouver.ca), this dataset contains historical records of employee remuneration and expenses from 2016 to 2023.
The AWS services used for this part are shown below:

### 🔹 Methodology:
- Data ingestion and cleaning using **AWS S3** and **Glue Databrew**
- Profiling and summarizing the dataset
- Analysis using **SQL in Athena** for identifying average expenses, minimum remuneration, and yearly trends
- Visualization with **QuickSight** and **Excel**

### 🔹 Tools & Technologies:
`AWS S3`, `Glue`, `Athena`, `SQL`, `Python`, `Excel`, `QuickSight`

### 🔹 Deliverables:
- Cleaned dataset in S3
- SQL queries for key business questions
- Summary graphs and interpretation of results

## 📈 Project 2: Descriptive Analysis

### 🔹 Project Title:
**Descriptive Analysis of City Remuneration Data**

### 🔹 Objective:
To provide summarized statistics (mean, minimum, trends) and compare those with visual outputs to verify the accuracy of ETL processes.

### 🔹 Dataset:
Employee remuneration and expenses dataset from the City of Vancouver (same dataset as EDA, used for deeper summarization).

### 🔹 Methodology:
- ETL pipeline built using **AWS Glue Studio**
- Aggregations performed on yearly expenses and remuneration
- Output stored in **CSV** and **Parquet** format in S3
- Visualizations developed for reporting purposes
- Matched output to summary graphs for data validation

### 🔹 Tools & Technologies:
`AWS Glue`, `S3`, `Athena`, `CloudWatch`, `Python`

### 🔹 Deliverables:
- ETL pipeline in Glue
- Transformed dataset in metrics folder
- Summary graphs matching ETL output
- Final insights documented

## 🧪 Project 3: Diagnostic Analysis

### 🔹 Project Title:
**Diagnostic Review of Substance Use Policy at University Canada West**

### 🔹 Objective:
To evaluate student awareness and perception of UCW’s substance use policy, identify gaps in policy communication, and recommend improvements for campus safety and health.

### 🔹 Background:
With rising concerns around substance misuse in post-secondary institutions, UCW conducted a survey to assess policy effectiveness and student feedback. The analysis aimed to identify areas of misunderstanding and risk.

### 🔹 Dataset:
Student survey data collected anonymously, covering topics such as awareness, usage frequency, and suggestions for improvement.

### 🔹 Methodology:
- Data cleaning and anonymization
- Visualization of response patterns and correlation between demographics and awareness
- Root cause analysis for knowledge gaps
- Recommendation development using diagnostic reasoning

### 🔹 Tools & Technologies:
`Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)`, `Excel`, `SurveyMonkey`

### 🔹 Deliverables:
- Cleaned and anonymized dataset
- Dashboards and charts visualizing key findings
- Final policy improvement report
